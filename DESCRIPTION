Title: wOGL: Weighted Overlapping Group Lasso for the selection of gene sets as groups
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Dan Huang, Geunsu Jo

Description: Gene set analysis aims to identify differentially expressed gene sets, often ignoring genetic network structure, which is less effective for sparse signals. Weighted Overlapping Group Lasso leverages network knowledge to identify interconnected genes, combining network-based regularization with overlapping group lasso, using l2-norm of regression coefficients for individual genes can play a role of the weight of gene sets for group selection.
